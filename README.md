Your SOC observed several workstations generating bursts of DNS queries to external resolvers. The traffic looked normal at first glance, but analysts flagged unusually long, random-looking subdomains and inconsistent query patterns. Youâ€™ve been given the capture.

Task: Determine if data exfiltration is happening via DNS. If so, reconstruct the stolen content. Provide the final recovered message (exact text). Briefly justify which stream is the real exfil path and why the others are decoys.
